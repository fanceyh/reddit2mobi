<p class=title></p>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>&quot;New handy controls like <strong>flashlight</strong>, hotspot, <strong>screen rotation</strong> and cast screen controls&quot;. Finally. </p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>I hope that you can customise which ones appear, not holding my breath but it would be great. </p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>There were runours of just that, after parts of the code &#39;leaked&#39;.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t customise it in the L developer preview.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Wait. I have screen rotation now. O.o is this just bringing it to all devices?</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s there for the Nexus 7, but someone thought it was brilliant to not include it for the 4 and 5. Fuck that someone in particular!</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>They&#39;re playing catch up with Samsung.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>I never know whether this kind of stuff is just in cyanogenmod or from stock. I often assume everyone has them.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>I know. I&#39;ve got gravitybox and just assume it&#39;s normal to have.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Moto X stock has it... Every phone I&#39;ve had pretty much since at least ICS has had it...</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>I have an N5 and an OPO. Although my N5 is more fluid, my OPO is way better at handling some things like for instance pressing on a quick setting to toggle it as opposed to holding it like on stock.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>People were using android without this stuff? Holy shit </p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Android 5.0 Lollipop</p>

<ul>
<li><p>works on/across all your devices</p></li>
<li><p>customization (that carries over from one device to another?)</p></li>
<li><p>pick up where you left off, so the songs, photos, apps, and even recent searches (I can see a NSFW situation in your future)</p></li>
<li><p>consistent design across devices</p></li>
<li><p>Now content responds to your touch, or even your voice, in more intuitive ways, and transitions between tasks are more fluid.</p></li>
<li><p>You can now adjust your settings so that only certain people and notifications can get through</p></li>
<li><p>new battery saver feature that extends the life of your device by up to 90 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>multiple user accounts and guest user mode for keeping your personal stuff private</p></li>
<li><p>you can now secure your device with a PIN, password, pattern, or even by pairing your phone to a trusted device like your watch or car with Smart Lock</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the official site: <a href="https://android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/">https://android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/</a></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>The security thing seems great.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>What am I missing? My phone already has all those security options. </p>

<p>What I really want is lock screen off when on a trusted WIFI network.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing that with Tasker for a while now, but I&#39;m sure an OS integrated function will work much better than my half-assed task.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>works on/across all your devices</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does that even mean? You mean my HTC Hero will now run Lollipop???</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>Probably more like it will work on your desktop, phone, and tablet.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>THE LG GENESIS IS BACK IN ACTION</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>It means that all your devices that are capable of running L will sync and feel the same.</p>

<p>So for the majority of people who just have an Android phone or maybe an Android phone and tablet....it doesn&#39;t mean much. (And that&#39;s assuming that phone/tablet are able to run Lollipop, which won&#39;t be the case for the majority of Android users for a while.)</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Yes, they&#39;ve finally got a battery saver, the one thing I miss from touchwiz.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Were these things not already in android?  Many of these seem like normal items that were already there, or have been in competitors (windows 8.1) for a while</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>pick up where you left off, so the songs, photos, apps, and even recent searches (I can see a NSFW situation in your future)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is already in place for searches and bookmarks, and it&#39;s why I don&#39;t log into my google account at work</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>As I plan on switching back to Android soon after a 2 year stint with Windows Phone, the line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can now adjust your settings so that only certain people and notifications can get through</p>
</blockquote>

<p>makes me really happy. On Windows Phone it is called Quiet Hours, and I really love it. Every night I got to bed, I turn it on. And then only my gf, my roommate and my one brother (who I trust not to call in the middle of the night unless it is an emergency) can get through. </p>

<p>I will be interested to see how Google makes this work. There are other nice things in the Windows Phone version (like break-through rules, anyone calls 2x&#39;s in 3 mins it will still ring, to help with emergencies). </p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Seems like they won&#39;t abandon the Nexus 5 <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/">http://www.google.com/nexus/</a></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>Makes sense considering the 6&#39;s screen size may be a little too large for some people.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>And considering it starts at $649</p>

<p>Edit: I think it is worth it if you&#39;re in the market for a phablet such as the Note 3/4, G Flex, and whatever else there is. The N6 being a cheaper and different option compared to the rest. Hell, the Note 4 unlocked goes for $850+ on Amazon and $750+ for an unlocked T-Mobile version. Say what you will, but I think the N6 would be the better option for me.</p>

<p>There is a reason they&#39;re still selling the N5. It is still an amazingly fast phone. </p>

<p>Compare the Nexus 6 to its competitors which I just listed and I think it&#39;s a great choice like the N5 was compared to other phones similar to its size.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>I guess that&#39;s a good thing, but it&#39;s awfully disappointing when the only reason I have been watching for the 6 is in hopes of getting a discounted 5.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>I was hoping we&#39;d get a refresh of the 5. I&#39;d like the 6&#39;s hardware with the 5&#39;s 5&quot; 1080p screen. Battery life would be practically eternal if you don&#39;t have to drive that big QHD display and you&#39;d have all the processing power you could need.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s incredible how it still costs that much. Even our own little provider in my small little country is selling it cheaper. </p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Also if people want the new Nexus 5 they can always look to the Moto X. It&#39;s basically just a smaller Nexus 6. </p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>And in true Nexus fashion, there are battery concerns and the price is right.  It won&#39;t be pure Android but its close.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>No stereo speakers though, which is a bummer. After playing &#39;cup the phone&#39; for god knows how long, I want a phone that puts the damn speakers where they very well should have been put right from the beginning.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Oh Shit! Go to the Nexus 5 click the star. This is what Google Play Music update will look like. It couldn&#39;t come soon enough. </p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Now to find out why it went out of stock and why they started doing replacements with refurbs instead of new ones. Seems like it&#39;s out of production, so are they updating it? </p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>So is there going to be a Nexus 5 refresh? New hardware? I need a new phone coming up around Christmas.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>&quot;...in the coming weeks&quot; noooo I wanted it today!</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>Well, they still need to update Now, Maps, GMail, YouTube, Camera, Calendar, Drive, Play Games, Play Music, Play Movies, Play Books, Rewards and Translate.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p><em>impatiently waits for the Play Music update.</em></p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>The updated apps will probably come with Lollipop and be able to take advantage of all the L APIs.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Thank god Androidify is updated and ready to go though. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Notice on the Nexus 5, 6 and so on there is no Hangouts icon?  It&#39;s replaced by a blue and white app icon instead.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Not really though. They kinda could release it before and just update the apps on the Play Store. </p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Alright, just got an Android phone, so kinda confused, is this just for Nexus phones or for every phone using Android OS. Like, is this a new/better/improved Kit Kat or is this something else entirely</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>Not strictly for Nexus, but whether or not your phone gets the update and how soon they do will depend on the manufacturer. </p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>KitKat is Android version 4.4(.4? Could be wrong on that.) Lollipop is Android version 5, so it is the newest version of Android, which all phones should get updates to, though older ones unfortunately won&#39;t. The Nexus devices will just get them first because their updates come straight from Google, while other devices get their updates from the OEM, so your update will have to come from HTC.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>4chan leaker (who&#39;s been pretty reliable) says nexus 5 is getting the update Friday. </p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ironic because lollipops are probably my least favourite sweet to share with other people.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>Sharing a single lollipop is definitely disgusting.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>But oh so intimate! Maybe that&#39;s what they were aiming for.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p><strong>Material Design</strong></p>

<p><em>A bold, colorful, and responsive UI design for consistent, intuitive experiences across all your devices</em></p>

<li><p>With Lollipop, incoming phone calls won’t interrupt what you’re watching or playing. You can choose to answer the call or just keep doing what you’re doing</p></li>

<p>DAMN. I thought the Nexus 5 supported this at the hardware level.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know if it will be supported by Google but the Nexus 5/Snapdragon 800 does have an audio core which should allow for the same functionality. </p>

<p>The multiple account support looks amazing, my paranoid friends will probably (not) let me use their phones. And brings full backup one step closer. </p>

<p>Also ART seems to be 4 times more efficient than Dalvik, that&#39;s twice what it was on the preview right? If it&#39;s 60 fps and with less than 20ms of screen response time I&#39;ll be the happiest man on earth. </p>

<p>An Ouya developer somewhere is softly shedding a tear...</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>They mean the first one that people will actually buy.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>The Ouya got a ton of sales during its kickstarter. It just happened to be really awful.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>Surprised no one is really talking about the Android TV nexus player. I&#39;m interested in it at the very least. I really like my android mini pc, but it&#39;s definitely got a number of flaws. It would be awesome to have a similar device made by a major manufacturer with all the bugs worked out. Hopefully, android tv will be flashable onto my existing mini pc at some point.</p>

<p>I was also interested in seeing that it is intel powered. I&#39;m curious, is it possible to install windows on intel android devices?</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>I lost interest instantly when I saw it had no ethernet. I was hoping for Chromecast + Limelight in one device, but there&#39;s no way I can stream games reasonably over WiFi.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>No Ethernet, really? I missed that. That is a huge disappointment</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t exactly lose interest, but my interest dropped significantly when I saw it was wifi only.</p>

<p>I love my Chromecast, but it&#39;s a bit flaky from time to time on wifi.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>At least it supports 5 Ghz unlike Chromecast.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually happy that I&#39;ll have a second device that can utilize 802.11ac.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>You can, actually. I play Crysis on my Macbook air with the Steam in home streaming all the time. Works really well.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>I am also curious about the android player. I have 2 chromecasts one for each tv so I probably won&#39;t get the player but it is still interesting and looks to be a real contender to the Roku, Apple TV, and FireTV.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>Yeah I feel kinda bad about purchasing my mini pc two months ago, since this may very well be the device I really want. However, it would be a nice consolation if I am able to flash android tv on it at some point.</p>

<li><div class="md"><p>Agreed. My biggest question about that player is whether it will support 5.1 audio. I know the chromecast doesn&#39;t (which I found out long after I purchased it).</p>

<p>As much as my chromecast covers me 99% of the time I&#39;d definitely pick up the android player if the price is right and it has 5.1 audio out. If google chose not to support surround sound again then I might have to just skip it in favor of some other competitors product which does.</p>

</div>
<ul>
<li><div class="md"><p>I was looking to upgrade because the battery on my 5 is starting to tank.  But not for a $650 buy in.</p>
</div>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div class="md"><p>I love my Nexus 5. I would consider upgrading if the screen wasn&#39;t so huge. The screen on the 5 is a perfect size. Anything smaller is too small, anything bigger is just overly large imo.</p>

<p>I&#39;m torn.  I actually like them all.  But I&#39;m disappointed with the motorola design of the Nexus 6.  Mainly that its a MotoX seemingly without any effort of differentiation.  The Nexus 9 and Nexus Player look pretty sweet.</p>
